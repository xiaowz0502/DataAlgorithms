Everything below the line of dashes is a valid error message.  If an input
is valid (not one of the INV test cases) and you output one of these
allowed error messages, the autograder will show you the error message,
which will help you with debugging.  For example, you rejected a valid
input, thinking that we forgot the -s or --stack.  If you receive that
error message for a valid test case, you know where to start debugging.

If you want to have more debugging help, you can add a second line after
the first.  The autograder won't show it to you, but it could be useful
for your own testing.  For example:

    cerr << "Invalid output mode specified" << endl;
    cerr << "  Invalid output mode is: " << outMode << endl;

Some of these may not be in the "Errors you must check for" section, but
are still useful for debugging purposes.
